# Matilda
Matilda is a telegram bot written in Python 3 to scrape news articles, written in order to allow me to get a better understanding of Python. This bot is purely for educational purposes.

Matilda is currently still in the development stage. Currently, I only have time to work on Matilda on the weekends, so development for this bot might be a little slow.
