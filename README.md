# Matilda
Matilda is a telegram bot written in Python 3 to scrape news articles, written in order to allow me to get a better understanding of Python. This bot is purely for educational purposes only.

# Supported Sites
Currently, Matilda supports only Straits Times. More sites will be added in future.

# Sample
A sample version of this bot is currently running on Telegram, under @matilda_jk_bot. Please feel free to add her to your groups.

# Credits
Thanks to LFlare for giving me the idea.
